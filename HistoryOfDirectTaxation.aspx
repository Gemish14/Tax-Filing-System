            It is a matter of general belief that taxes on income and wealth are of recent 
            origin but there is enough evidence to show that taxes on income in some form or 
            the other were levied even in primitive and ancient communities. The origin of 
            the word &quot;Tax&quot; is from &quot;Taxation&quot; which means an estimate. These were levied 
            either on the sale and purchase of merchandise or livestock and were collected 
            in a haphazard manner from time to time. Nearly 2000 years ago, there went out a 
            decree from Ceaser Augustus that all the world should be taxed. In Greece, 
            Germany and Roman Empires, taxes were also levied sometime on the basis of 
            turnover and sometimes on occupations. For many centuries, revenue from taxes 
            went to the Monarch. In Northern England, taxes were levied on land and on 
            moveable property such as the Saladin title in 1188. Later on, these were 
            supplemented by introduction of poll taxes, and indirect taxes known as &quot;Ancient 
            Customs&quot; which were duties on wool, leather and hides. These levies and taxes in 
            various forms and on various commodities and professions were imposed to meet 
            the needs of the Governments to meet their military and civil expenditure and 
            not only to ensure safety to the subjects but also to meet the common needs of 
            the citizens like maintenance of roads, administration of justice and such other 
            functions of the State.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            In India, the system of direct taxation as it is known today, has been in force 
            in one form or another even from ancient times. There are references both in 
            Manu Smriti and Arthasastra to a variety of tax measures. Manu, the ancient sage 
            and law-giver stated that the king could levy taxes, according to Sastras. The 
            wise sage advised that taxes should be related to the income and expenditure of 
            the subject. He, however, cautioned the king against excessive taxation and 
            stated that both extremes should be avoided namely either complete absence of 
            taxes or exorbitant taxation. According to him, the king should arrange the 
            collection of taxes in such a manner that the subjects did not feel the pinch of 
            paying taxes. He laid down that traders and artisans should pay 1/5th of their 
            profits in silver and gold, while the agriculturists were to pay 1/6th, 1/8th 
            and 1/10th of their produce depending upon their circumstances. The detailed 
            analysis given by Manu on the subject clearly shows the existence of a 
            well-planned taxation system, even in ancient times. Not only this, taxes were 
            also levied on various classes of people like actors, dancers, singers and even 
            dancing girls. Taxes were paid in the shape of gold-coins, cattle, grains, 
            raw-materials and also by rendering personal service.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            The learned author K.B.Sarkar commends the system of taxation in ancient India 
            in his book &quot;Public Finance in Ancient India&quot;, (1978 Edition) as follows:-<br 
                style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
            &quot;Most of the taxes of Ancient India were highly productive. The admixture of 
            direct taxes with indirect Taxes secured elasticity in the tax system, although 
            more emphasis was laid on direct tax. The tax-structure was a broad based one 
            and covered most people within its fold. The taxes were varied and the large 
            variety of taxes reflected the life of a large and composit population&quot;.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            However, it is Kautilya&#39;s Arthasastra, which deals with the system of taxation 
            in a real elaborate and planned manner. This well known treatise on state crafts 
            written sometime in 300 B.C., when the Mauryan Empire was as its glorious 
            upwards move, is truly amazing, for its deep study of the civilisation of that 
            time and the suggestions given which should guide a king in running the State in 
            a most efficient and fruitful manner. A major portion of Arthasastra is devoted 
            by Kautilya to financial matters including financial administration. According 
            to famous statesman, the Mauryan system, so far as it applied to agriculture, 
            was a sort of state landlordism and the collection of land revenue formed an 
            important source of revenue to the State. The State not only collected a part of 
            the agricultural produce which was normally one sixth but also levied water 
            rates, octroi duties, tolls and customs duties. Taxes were also collected on 
            forest produce as well as from mining of metals etc. Salt tax was an important 
            source of revenue and it was collected at the place of its extraction.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            Kautilya described in detail, the trade and commerce carried on with foreign 
            countries and the active interest of the Mauryan Empire to promote such trade. 
            Goods were imported from China, Ceylon and other countries and levy known as a 
            vartanam was collected on all foreign commodities imported in the country. There 
            was another levy called Dvarodaya which was paid by the concerned businessman 
            for the import of foreign goods. In addition, ferry fees of all kinds were 
            levied to augment the tax collection.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            Collection of Income-tax was well organised and it constituted a major part of 
            the revenue of the State. A big portion was collected in the form of income-tax 
            from dancers, musicians, actors and dancing girls, etc. This taxation was not 
            progressive but proportional to the fluctuating income. An excess Profits Tax 
            was also collected. General Sales-tax was also levied on sales and the sale and 
            the purchase of buildings was also subject to tax. Even gambling operations were 
            centralised and tax was collected on these operations. A tax called yatravetana 
            was levied on pilgrims. Though revenues were collected from all possible 
            sources, the underlying philosophy was not to exploit or over-tax people but to 
            provide them as well as to the State and the King, immunity from external and 
            internal danger. The revenues collected in this manner were spent on social 
            services such as laying of roads, setting up of educational institutions, 
            setting up of new villages and such other activities beneficial to the 
            community.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            The reason why Kautilya gave so much importance to public finance and the 
            taxation system in the Arthasastra is not far to seek. According to him, the 
            power of the government depended upon the strength of its treasury. He states – 
            &quot;From the treasury, comes the power of the government, and the Earth whose 
            ornament is the treasury, is acquired by means of the Treasury and Army&quot;. 
            However, he regarded revenue and taxes as the earning of the sovereign for the 
            services which were to be rendered by him to the people and to afford them 
            protection and to maintain law and order. Kautilya emphasised that the King was 
            only a trustee of the land and his duty was to protect it and to make it more 
            and more productive so that land revenue could be collected as a principal 
            source of income for the State. According to him, tax was not a compulsory 
            contribution to be made by the subject to the State but the relationship was 
            based on Dharma and it was the King&#39;s sacred duty to protect its citizens in 
            view of the tax collected and if the King failed in his duty, the subject had a 
            right to stop paying taxes, and even to demand refund of the taxes paid.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            Kautilya has also described in great detail the system of tax administration in 
            the Mauryan Empire. It is remarkable that the present day tax system is in many 
            ways similar to the system of taxation in vogue about 2300 years ago. According 
            to the Arthasastra, each tax was specific and there was no scope for 
            arbitratiness. Precision determined the schedule of each payment, and its time, 
            manner and quantity being all pre-determined. The land revenue was fixed at 1/6 
            share of the produce and import and export duties were determined on advalorem 
            basis. The import duties on foreign goods were roughly 20 per cent of their 
            value. Similarly, tolls, road cess, ferry charges and other levies were all 
            fixed. Kautilya&#39;s concept of taxation is more or less akin to the modern system 
            of taxation. His over all emphasis was on equity and justice in taxation. The 
            affluent had to pay higher taxes as compared to the not so fortunate. People who 
            were suffering from diseases or were minor and students were exempted from tax 
            or given suitable remissions. The revenue collectors maintained up-to-date 
            records of collection and exemptions. The total revenue of the State was 
            collected from a large number of sources as enumerated above. There were also 
            other sources like profits from Stand land (Sita) religious taxes (Bali) and 
            taxes paid in cash (Kara). Vanikpath was the income from roads and traffic paid 
            as tolls.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            He placed land revenues and taxes on commerce under the head of tax revenues. 
            These were fixed taxes and included half yearly taxes like Bhadra, Padika, and 
            Vasantika. Custom duties and duties on sales, taxes on trade and professions and 
            direct taxes comprised the taxes on commerce. The non-tax revenues consisted of 
            produce of sown lands, profits accuring from the manufacture of oil, sugarcane 
            and beverage by the State, and other transactions carried on by the State. 
            Commodities utilised on marriage occasions, the articles needed for sacrificial 
            ceremonies and special kinds of gifts were exempted from taxation. All kinds of 
            liquor were subject to a toll of 5 precent. Tax evaders and other offenders were 
            fined to the tune of 600 panas.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            Kautilya also laid down that during war or emergencies like famine or floods, 
            etc. the taxation system should be made more stringent and the king could also 
            raise war loans. The land revenue could be raised from 1/6th to 1/4th during the 
            emergencies. The people engaged in commerce were to pay big donations to war 
            efforts.</p>
        <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify;">
            Taking an overall view, it can be said without fear of contradiction that 
            Kautilya&#39;s Arthasastra was the first authoritative text on public finance, 
            administration and the fiscal laws in this country. His concept of tax revenue 
            and the on-tax revenue was a unique contribution in the field of tax 
            administration. It was he, who gave the tax revenues its due importance in the 
            running of the State and its far-reaching contribution to the prosperity and 
            stability of the Empire. It is truly an unique treatise. It lays down in precise 
            terms the art of state craft including economic and financialadministration.</p>

            The rapid changes in administration of direct taxes, during the last decades, 
            reflect the history of socio-economic thinking in India. From 1922 to the 
            present day changes in direct tax laws have been so rapid that except in the 
            bare outlines, the traces of the I.T. Act, 1922 can hardly be seen in the 1961 
            Act as it stands amended to date. It was but natural, in these circumstances, 
            that the set up of the department should not only expand but undergo structural 
            changes as well.</p>

            The organisational history of the Income-tax Department starts in the year 1922. 
            The Income-tax Act, 1922, gave, for the first time, a specific nomenclature to 
            various Income-tax authorities. The foundation of a proper system of 
            administration was thus laid. In 1924, Central Board of Revenue Act constituted 
            the Board as a statutory body with functional responsibilities for the 
            administration of the Income-tax Act. Commissioners of Income- tax were 
            appointed separately for each province and Assistant Commissioners and 
            Income-tax Officers were provided under their control. The amendments to the 
            Income tax Act, in 1939, made two vital structural changes: (i) appellate 
            functions were separated from administrative functions; a class of officers, 
            known as Appellate Assistant Commissioners, thus came into existence, and (ii) a 
            central charge was created in Bombay. In 1940, with a view to exercising 
            effective control over the progress and inspection of the work of Income-tax 
            Department throughout India, the very first attached office of the Board, called 
            Directorate of Inspection (Income Tax) - was created. As a result of separation 
            of executive and judicial functions, in 1941, the Appellate Tribunal came into 
            existence. In the same year, a central charge was created in Calcutta also.</p>

            2.1</span>World War II brought unusual profits to businessmen. During 1940 to 
            1947, Excess Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax were introduced and their 
            administration handed over to the Department (These were later repealed in 1946 
            and 1949 respectively). In 1951, the 1st Voluntary Disclosure Scheme was brought 
            in. It was during this period, in 1946, that a few Group &#39;A&#39; officers were 
            directly recruited. Later on in 1953, the Group &#39;A&#39; Service was formally 
            constituted as the &#39;Indian Revenue Service&#39;.</p>

            2.2</span>This era was characterised by considerable emphasis on development of 
            investigation techniques. In 1947, Taxation on Income (Investigation) Commission 
            was set up which was declared ultra vires by the Supreme Court in 1956 but the 
            necessity of deep investigation had by then been realised. In 1952, the 
            Directorate of Inspection (Investigation) was set up. It was in this year that a 
            new cadre known as Inspectors of Income Tax was created. The increase in &#39;large 
            income&#39; cases necessitated checking of the work done by departmental officers. 
            Thus in 1954, the Internal Audit Scheme was introduced in the Income-tax 
            Department.</p>

            2.3</span>As indicated earlier, in 1946, for the first time a few Group A 
            officers were recruited in the department. Training them was important. The new 
            recruits were sent to Bombay and Calcutta where they were trained, though not in 
            an organised manner. In 1957, I.R.S. (Direct Taxes) Staff College started 
            functioning in Nagpur. Today this attached office of the Board functions under a 
            Director-General. It is called the National Academy of Direct Taxes. By 1963, 
            the I.T. department, burdened with the administration of several other Acts like 
            W.T., G.T., E.D., etc., had expanded to such an extent that it was considered 
            necessary to put it under a separate Board. Consequently, the Central Board of 
            Revenue Act, 1963 was passed. The Central Board of Direct Taxes was constituted, 
            under this Act.</p>

            2.4</span>The developing nature of the economy of the country brought with it 
            both steep rates of taxes and black incomes. In 1965, the Voluntary Disclosure 
            Scheme was brought in followed by the 1975 Disclosure Scheme. Finally, the need 
            for a permanent settlement mechanism resulted in the creation of the Settlement 
            Commission.</p>

            2.5</span>A very important administrative change occurred during this period. 
            The recovery of arrears of tax which till 1970 was the function of State 
            authorities was passed on to the departmental officers. A whole new wing of 
            Officers - Tax Recovery Officers was created and a new cadre of post of Tax 
            Recovery Commissioners was introduced w.e.f. 1-1-1972.</p>

            2.6</span>In order to improve the quality of work, in 1977, a new cadre known as 
            IAC (Assessment) and in 1978 another cadre known as CIT (Appeals) were created. 
            The Commissioners&#39; cadre was further reorganised and five posts of Chief 
            Commissioners (Administration) were created in 1981.</p>

            2.8</span>Computerisation : Computerisation in the Income-tax Department started 
            with the setting up of the Directorate of Income tax (Systems) in 1981. 
            Initially computerisation of processing of challans was taken up. For this 3 
            computer centres were first set up in 1984-85 in metropolitan cities using SN-73 
            systems. This was later extended to 33 major cities by 1989. The computerized 
            activities were subsequently extended to allotment of PAN under the old series, 
            allotment of TAN, and pay roll accounting. These computer centres used batch 
            process with dumb terminals for data entry.<br 
                style="box-sizing: border-box;" />
            In 1993 a Working Group was set up by the Government to recommend 
            computerisation of the department. Based on the report of the Working Group a 
            comprehensive computerisation plan was approved by the Government in October, 
            1993. In pursuance of this, Regional Computer Centres were set up in Delhi, 
            Mumbai, and Chennai in 1994-95 with RS6000/59H Servers. PCs were first provided 
            to officers in these cities in phases. The Plan involved networking of all users 
            on LAN/WAN. Network with leased data circuits were accordingly set up in Delhi, 
            Mumbai and Chennai in Phase-I during 1995-96. A National Computer Centre was set 
            up at Delhi in 1996-97. Integrated application software were developed and 
            deployed during 1997-99. Thereafter, RS6000 type mid range servers were provided 
            in the other 33 Computer Centres in various major cities in 1996-97. These were 
            connected to the National Computer Centre through leased lines. PCs were 
            provided to officers of different level upto ITOs in stages between 1997 and 
            1999. In phase II offices in 57 cities were brought on the network and linked to 
            RCCs and NCC.</p>
