    Grievance redressal mechanism</h1>
<p style="background-color: #FFFFFF">
&nbsp; The grievances of assessees can arise due to a number of reasons - delay in 
    transfer of files, harassment during a search, a survey or assessment 
    proceedings, discourteous behavior of officials, at the time of hearings etc. 
    Grievance redressal is a major aspect of the department’s public relations 
    exercise. The Department has created an elaborate grievance redressal machinery, 
    to cater to this aspect. This machinery is created with the following objects:- 
    i) Prompt redressal of every public grievance ii) Safeguarding the rights and 
    dignity of a taxpayer in a democratic set-up ii) Enforcing higher standards of 
    accountability on officers and staff of the department by taking disciplinary 
    action against erring persons in selected cases iii) Gaining insight into the 
    working of the system through the feedback received from the public with a view 
    to effecting appropriate changes in the system iv) Acquiring better knowledge 
    about officers and staff v) Using public grievance as an input for the 
    functioning of the department’s vigilance machinery For this purpose, a 
    hierarchy of Grievance Cells has been created in the Department, as under:- a) 
    Central Grievance Cell under the Chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes b) 
    Regional Grievance Cells under the Chief Commissioners of/ Director Generals of 
    Income-tax c) Grievance Cell under the out station Commissioners of Income-tax 
    Central grievance cell : This has the original function of attending to public 
    grievances received directly by it. It also has supervisory function of 
    overseeing the Regional and other Grievance Cells. The Regional Grievance Cell 
    submits two-monthly reports to this Cell. Director (HQ), CBDT is generally 
    responsible for the activities of the Central Grievance Cell. Regional grievance 
    cell : This has original jurisdiction of attending to the grievances relating to 
    the jurisdictions of CITs, CITs(Central), DITs(Inv.) stationed at the 
    headquarters of the respective CCITs/DGITs as also out-stationed CITs (Appeals). 
    It supervises the functioning of the Grievance Cells functioning under 
    out-stationed CITs/CITs (Central)/DIT (Inv.). It sends a consolidated two 
    monthly report to the C.B.D.T., in respect of Grievances received by it and 
    outstationed Grievance Cell. Grievance cells under out station Commissioners 
    /Director Generals of Income Tax These are located at different places, wherein 
    the headquarters of CIT/CIT(Central)/DIT(Inv.) are located away from the 
    headquarters of the Chief Commissioner/Director General of Income Tax. These 
    Grievance Cells attend to public grievances, relating to assessees within the 
    respective jurisdictions. They have to send a two-monthly report in the 
    prescribed proforma, to the Regional Grievance Cell. Central Board of Direct 
    Taxes Service Quality Manual Doc. No. CBDT/SQP/7.3/01 Revision No. – 00 Revision 
    Date – 00 Prepared by : DIT (O&amp;MS) Issued by : DGIT (Systems) Approved by : 
    Chairman, CBDT 62 The Procedure prescribed for dealing with the grievance 
    petition is as under Whenever a grievance petition is received by any office 
    other than the Grievance Cell, the original petition has to be sent to the 
    Grievance Cell concerned. The officer receiving the petition shall keep a copy 
    of the same and immediately act on it. A compliance report has to be sent to the 
    Grievance Cell through proper channel, on the basis of the action taken. The 
    Grievance Cell in turn registers the grievance and allots a running number to 
    it. The Grievance Cells have to ensure that, all the grievances are redressed 
    within a reasonable time by the field officers. Where it is not possible to help 
    the assessee, he should be informed accordingly. It is mandatory to send 
    grievance petitions to the field officers, only through the respective 
    CCITs/DGITs (Inv.). Similarly, reports are also received only through them. The 
    object of this is to ensure that the supervisory officers know about the working 
    of the officers and staff functioning under them. Where the assessee sends 
    petition simultaneously to different hierarchical officers, the out station 
    Grievance Cell or the Regional Grievance Cell, on getting information that the 
    grievance is already registered in the Regional Grievance Cell or the Central 
    Grievance Cell, may de-register such a grievance and make appropriate 
    corrections while reporting. While sending a grievance petition to a 
    Commissioner/Officer for redressal, the officer should be asked to report 
    compliance, within a specified time. Each grievance must be pursued till it is 
    closed, so that every petition received, is ultimately disposed of. The 
    Commissioner/Chief Commissioner should analyze the areas where grievances are 
    common and take systematic measures to prevent recurrence of such grievances. 
    Further, action has to be taken against delinquent officials, in really bad 
    cases. Adequate publicity has also to be given regarding the existence of the 
    above Grievance Cells. Maintenance of registers and reports A grievance register 
    has to be maintained by every Grievance Cell and every Assessing Officer, in the 
    proforma indicated in Annexure-I. Every grievance should be segregated into 
    various categories, as indicated in Annexure-II. A bi-monthly report should be 
    sent by the out station Grievance Cell to the Regional Grievance Cell, (for 
    proforma see Annexure-II). The bi-monthly report should reach the Regional 
    Grievance Cell by second week of February, April, June, August, October and 
    December of every year, in respect of all proceedings of previous two months. 
    For example, the reports for the months of December and January should reach the 
    Regional Grievance Cell by the second week of February. B. For Buildings Where 
    ASK is functional It is worthwhile to mention here that as stated earlier that 
    the CBDT has planned to impart excellence in service delivery through setting up 
    of ASK at various buildings of the Department which is a single window mechanism 
    for the taxpayers to get their grievances resolved. ASK Central Board of Direct 
    Taxes Service Quality Manual Doc. No. CBDT/SQP/7.3/01 Revision No. – 00 Revision 
    Date – 00 Prepared by : DIT (O&amp;MS) Issued by : DGIT (Systems) Approved by : 
    Chairman, CBDT 63 functions with the help of well designed software which 
    registers the grievances of taxpayers allots unique number and transfers the 
    same to the respective sections for resolution and keeps track. The software is 
    robust enough to deal with the grievances of the taxpayers inasmuch as now there 
    is no need to keep manual registers for tracking the status of the grievances. 
    The software gives details of grievances received and their redressal. Once the 
    data base of grievances is prepared, this would help in taking corrective and 
    preventive measures. Hence there is no need to maintain any manual registers at 
    ASK locations. However, the CBDT is committed to meet all standards i.e. a) 
    Identification of Complaint prone areas in a systematic manner and determine the 
    time norms for their redress The complaints received/redressed would be analysed 
    to identify complaint prone areas for which feedback from Nodal officer at Unit 
    level would be obtained. b) Providing information concerning complaints handling 
    process in clear language and formats accessible to all. Such information shall 
    include: 1. Where the how complaints can be made: For receiving complaints, 
    jurisdiction chart is placed at ASK Centres to facilitate taxpayers to file 
    their complaints at ASK 2. Minimum information to be provided by the complainant 
    No such proforma can be devised at this stage as there are multiple services for 
    which complaints are expected to be received. 3. Time limit within which the 
    complaint will be closed. Time limits within which the complaint will be closed 
    is given in the citizens’ charter c) Widely publicizing the information about 
    complaint handling process The complaint handling process is available on all 
    the two departmental websites i.e. incometaxindia.gov.in and 
    incometaxindiapr.gov.in. d) Unique identification of the complaint and recording 
    necessary information: At ASK unique identification is given on the spot and 
    relevant detailed are regarding through a specifically designed software. e) 
    Scrutiny of the complaints and its categorization as critical, major or minor: 
    Keeping in view the importance of services included in the citizens’ charter, 
    all the complaints received are critical and due weightage is given to all the 
    complaints. Hence it is not required to categorise the complaints. Central Board 
    of Direct Taxes Service Quality Manual Doc. No. CBDT/SQP/7.3/01 Revision No. – 
    00 Revision Date – 00 Prepared by : DIT (O&amp;MS) Issued by : DGIT (Systems) 
    Approved by : Chairman, CBDT 64 f) Acknowledgement of each complaint promptly 
    giving the complaint promptly giving the complaint number alongwith an 
    indication of the redress time and the name, designation and telephone number of 
    the employee to be contacted for all future correspondence. The complaints are 
    acknowledged at ASK and a Unique number is given. The disposal time of the 
    complaint is given in citizens’ charter. The name, designation and telephone 
    number of the PGO is displayed at ASK for future correspondence. g) 
    Investigation of relevant circumstances and information relating to the 
    complaint. The level of investigation shall be commensurate with the seriousness 
    and severity of the complaint. If the complaint cannot be immediately resolved, 
    it shall be dealt in a manner which would lead to its effective redress as soon 
    as possible and the complainant shall be intimated. Investigation would lie with 
    PGO, who is an officer at JS level. If the complaint is not redressed within 
    time frame, there is a provision in the software to send an interim reply. h) 
    Communication of the decision to the complainant regarding his complaint 
    immediately after the decision is taken and getting his feedback. In case the 
    decision is not in line with the remedy requested by the complainant, the 
    justification for the decision taken along with alternative internal and 
    external recourse available for appeal shall also be intimated after which the 
    complaint shall be closed. Most of the services included in the citizens’ 
    charter are in the form of implementation of Incometax Act/Rules. The Act itself 
    has a very detailed appellate procedure. i) Nominating ‘Ombudsman’ who could be 
    approached if normal service delivery mechanism does not respond. Government of 
    India has appointed Ombudsmen at various stations to look into the grievances of 
    taxpayers if normal delivery system does not respond. The Nodal Officers at Unit 
    Level where ASK has been made functional are designated as Public Grievance 
    Officers. They will send a copy of bi-monthly reports to the Nodal Officer at 
    apex level.</p>
